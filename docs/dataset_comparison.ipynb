    "The Lunar feature set was chosen through domain-knowledge reasoning, selecting one representative feature from each information category:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. `interactions` (index 2) — Proxy for Market Attention\n",
    "- Measures total engagements (likes, shares, comments) across all social posts about the coin\n",
    "- Preferred over `posts_created` or `contributors_active` because **engagement depth** matters more than raw post count — a single viral tweet with 100k likes carries more signal than 1000 low-engagement posts\n",
    "- High interaction spikes often precede or coincide with price volatility\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. `sentiment` (index 5) — Direct Measure of Crowd Mood\n",
    "- LunarCrush's aggregated sentiment score (0–100) derived from NLP analysis of social posts\n",
    "- Captures the **direction** of social attention — `interactions` tells us *how much* people are talking, `sentiment` tells us *how they feel*\n",
    "- Pairing engagement volume with sentiment direction provides complementary signals\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. `close` (index 9) — Prediction Target & Autoregressive Anchor\n",
    "- The closing price is the prediction target in both configurations\n",
    "- Including it as an input feature enables **autoregressive learning** — the model sees past closing prices to predict future ones\n",
    "- Provides the price-scale anchor that grounds the social features\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. `galaxy_score` (index 10) — Composite Meta-Feature\n",
    "- LunarCrush's proprietary score that blends social activity, engagement, sentiment, and market technicals into a single 0–100 indicator\n",
    "- Acts as a **pre-fused summary** of multiple signals — effectively a feature-engineered input that captures cross-domain interactions\n",
    "- Provides information compression: one number that reflects the overall \"health\" of a coin's social + market standing"
